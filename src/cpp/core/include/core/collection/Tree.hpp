   The tree.hh library for C++ provides an STL-like container class
   for n-ary trees, templated over the data stored at the
   nodes. Various types of iterators are provided (post-order,
   pre-order, and others). Where possible the access methods are
   compatible with the STL or alternative algorithms are
   available.
